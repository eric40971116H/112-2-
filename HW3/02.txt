2.3 DIODE APPROXIMATIONS
In Section 2.2 we revealed that the results obtained using the approximate piecewiselinear equivalent model were quite close, if not equal, to the response obtained using
the full characteristics. In fact, if one considers all the variations possible due to tolerances, temperature, and so on, one could certainly consider one solution to be “as
accurate” as the other. Since the use of the approximate model normally results in a
reduced expenditure of time and effort to obtain the desired results, it is the approach
that will be employed in this book unless otherwise specified. Recall the following:
The primary purpose of this book is to develop a general knowledge of the behavior, capabilities, and possible areas of application of a device in a manner
that will minimize the need for extensive mathematical developments.
The complete piecewise-linear equivalent model introduced in Chapter 1 was not
employed in the load-line analysis because rav is typically much less than the other
series elements of the network. If rav should be close in magnitude to the other series
elements of the network, the complete equivalent model can be applied in much the
same manner as described in Section 2.2.
In preparation for the analysis to follow, Table 2.1 was developed to review the
important characteristics, models, and conditions of application for the approximate
and ideal diode models. Although the silicon diode is used almost exclusively due
